    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon revolutionised the electric cars.
Founder of Space Exploration Technologies, also known as SpaceX.
Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system Hyperloop.
In 2015 Musk announced the creation of OpenAI.
In 1999 Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2.
In 1983 he taught himself computer programming and at age 12, sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar for approximately US$500. </p>
    <p class="text_column">SPACE X:
 SpaceX was founded in 2002 by entrepreneur Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs, but more likely - the colonization of Mars.
SpaceX started with the smallest orbital rocket, instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle. 
 SpaceX has since developed the Falcon launch vehicle family and the Dragon spacecraft family, which both currently deliver payloads into Earth orbit.
  In 2005, SpaceX had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for Responsive Small Spacelift launch services by the United States Air Force, which could allow the Air Force to purchase up to $100 million worth of launches from the company.
  In 2017 SpaceX announced that it will send privately crewed dragon spacecraft beyond the moon next year.

    <p class="text_column">Musk's vehicle company, Tesla’s use electric motors that have two moving parts and single-speed “transmissions” that have no gears. The company says its drivetrain has about 17 moving parts compared with about 200 in a conventional internal combustion drivetrain. The Tesla system is virtually maintenance-free. And because it is controlled by electronics, many adjustments and even repairs to the Tesla system can be made through software adjustments
	Hyperloop is a passenger and freight transportation that would propel a pod-like vehicle through a reduced-pressure tube that would exceed airliner speed. The pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track using passive magnetic levitation or air bearings. The tubes could also go above ground on columns or underground, eliminating the dangers of grade crossings. It is hoped that the system will be highly energy-efficient, quiet and autonomous.
