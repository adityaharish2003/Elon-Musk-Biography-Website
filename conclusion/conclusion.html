    <p class="text_column">Musk is for many people an idol because of the amazing things he has done. His companies are ground-breaking in the areas of outer space, the automotive industry and the solar industry. He is a source of inspiration to many individuals of today. Maybe in this way a group of young, smart and innovative engineers, or in general thinkers, will arise and will take on the challenges of the future: global warming, overpopulation, polution, space exploration and so on.
 </p>
    <p class="text_column">There is still a long path to go for our generation and the generation to come to achieve the perfect planet Earth, where there are no problems like polution or global warming. Musk is one of the big steps towards that future.
 </p>
    <p class="text_column">Said by Elon Musk himself,<strong> "Have you ever wondered why the best success stories mostly begin with failure??
Some people say that failure is the first step to success, and there is a man who invented the bulb he said this famous quote “I have not failed, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” well it’s a great quote, isn’t it? But do you know what I think about “why most success stories begin with failure?” Because they haven’t stopped at the failure, they keep on pushing their limits irrespective of their circumstances.</strong>""
